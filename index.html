                                <span>By Oene Dijk</span>
                                <p><br>It was an educational tour. 
                                    Who mapped out the differences in the neighbourhoods.
                                    We walked through the zuid-as and then through the neighbourhoods of Buitenveldert-West and Apollo.
                                    There was a lot of difference between the neighbourhoods. The zuid-as was mostly high-rise building with great architectural buildings.
                                     Buitenveldert-west was more of a grid layout with green squares in between. The houses were simple houses with almost non-architectural touches. after that, we walked through Apollobuurt. 
                                     A neighbourhood with space and a more luxurious design. <br><br>
                                    It was a great tour and a big thanks to Oene. </p>

                                <p>This is a Museum designed by Ben van Berkel.
                                    I did not found the building so spectacular from the outside.
                                    Inside it becomes more interesting with the difference in light intensities,
                                    layout and also the undulating roof (see figure).
                                    The museum focuses on archaeology, ancient art and modern art. 
                                    With a lot of interactive ways to tell you a story. 
                                    Which was really nice.<br><br>

                                   The route was different from the rest of the old building. 
                                   I like this because you can see what is the original building and what did they add (see picture). 
                                   It had many interactive ways to convey the information. 
                                   The atmosphere matched well with the information that was told and overall a great experience. <br><br>
                                    Again thanks to Hendrinks and Verstegen for this experience.

                                <p>Naturalis Biodiversity Center is a natural history museum in Leiden. 
                                    This is where most of the Dutch natural history lies, with a considerable amount of variation in collections. 
                                    From insect and molluscs to large reptiles. 
                                    Everything with nature could be found here. 
                                    It seemed very impressive to me to see what is or had been around you all the time. 
                                    Unfortunately, I couldn't be by the excursion of Leiden due to quarantine.<br><br>
                                    Thanks, Hendriks and Verstegen for what was probably a nice trip again.</p>

                                <p>Another museum in Leiden which was visited that day. Was Museum De Lakenhal.
                                    A city museum designed by Arent van 's-Gravesande that display the history and fine art of Leiden.
                                    With a great range of artists. From Jan Lievens to Theo van Doesburg, also better known from "the style".
                                    The museum offers a lot of art, especially paintings from the nearby areas.
                                    Although I am not well known in painting, I would have liked to be there, because
                                    there are a number of really well-known paintings and to see them in real life is something quite different.<br><br>
                                    Thanks again Hendriks and Verstegen for what would probably have been a nice trip again.</p>

                                <span>By Paul Dekker</span>
                                <p>A tour given by Paul Dekker, who worked there for many years and had a lot of input in the installation and design of the building. 
                                    He walked us through the whole building with public area's as well as non-public area's. 
                                    At the different places, he tells a story and what his thought process was. 
                                    It was a tour which made me think there is a lot more going on what isn't visible to most of us. 
                                    As a guest, you see much less of the building then a person who workes there or design the building. 
                                    It can make a building better if you know how it workes.<br><br>
                                    Thank you Paul Dekker for this amazing tour through the Amphion theatre.

                                <p>After the Amphion Theatre, we went to Pavilion de Postbank in Rheden.
                                    The pavilion was designed by architect Mastenbroek and is very striking in the park Veluwezoom.
                                    It is a building where you can rest for a while and eat or drink something. 
                                    In order to give it less impact on the environment, only sustainable and environmentally friendly materials have been used. 
                                    For example, tree trunks and stones have been used for construction. We went in here for something to eat and drink. 
                                    Inside, the sustainable and environmentally friendly materials are continued and the toilet offers a view over the Veluwe.
                                    It's an amazing building in its environment.<br><br>
                                    Thanks, Hendriks and Verstegen for showing us this great building

                                <p>As the very last excursion 
                                    of this minor, it was one that is close to school.
                                    Musis Sacrum is located in arhnem. It is a Concertgebouw designed by architect Hendrik Willem Fromberg.
                                    Who has built a beautiful building. Where both the exterior and the interior have been well thought out.
                                    So besides that, you can come there for concerts and theatre, the building itself is also something to admire.
                                    Unfortunately, I could not attend, but luckily I already saw this during the walking tour in week 1 and also a presentation was given at artez by fellow students. <br><br>
                                    Thanks, Hendriks and Verstegen for these great excursions. It was a bit different than usual, but you arranged it very well.</p>

                            <p>The very first thing we had to do for the project was to look up some reference projects. 
                                This will help you by designing your building because it makes you think about other buildings and form an opinion about it.
                                This was also often reflected in the lessons.
                                Below are a few pictures I chose that inspired me.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <div id="imgref"><ul style="text-align: left; color: #7a7a7a;">
                                    <li>First image was chosen because of the idea of having a green roof that is accessible to everyone.</li>                               
                                    <br>
                                    <li>The second image was chosen because of the park on the roof that can be used by the residents. 
                                        This also gives a beautiful view of the city.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>The third image is in here because of the dynamics of the building. 
                                        It feels like it can revolve around the middle cylinder.</li> 
                                    <br>
                                    <li>The last image represents a beautiful image of the sleek modern architecture combined with a somewhat more chaotic natural architecture. <br>
                                        The combination is what it makes so inspiring for me.</li>

                            <h3>Location, Theme and Program</h3>
                            <p>After the reference buildings, it was time to start designing our own building. 
                                The first steps were to choose a location. 
                                A theme for that location/building and write a program. 
                                These were the most important steps because after this choice you will most likely not switch and work the next 2 semesters on that type of project. 
                                So it's not an easy choice.
                            <h3>location</h3>
                            <p>First, a choice was made for the location. After 3 walking tours, a bike tour and online research. 
                                I ended up at the Bartok park.
                                The park is close to the shopping streets and the centre. 
                                It was originally a gift from Burgerzoo and temporarily placed here. 
                                It has since become an iconic park, but Arnhem's plans were to relocate this park. 
                                This gives me the opportunity to build my building on this piece of land close to the centre.
                            </p>

                                        The size of the lot is 1200 square meters with a circumference of 135 meters.

                            <h3>Theme</h3>
                            <p>Before coming up with a theme, was it also useful to have in mind what you want to do with the place.
                                I had in mind that I wanted a retail building where the roof could also be used with a view of the shopping centre.
                                The theme that has been devised was: <br><br> "A modern shopping centre with an original place to hang out."<br><br>
                                With this theme in mind, I went ahead and drew up a program for the building.</p>
                            <h3>Program</h3>
                            <p>The program is made to clarify what you want in the building and what is needed. 
                                Also how much space this would take up or want it to take up. 
                                At first, the feedback about the program was that it was not complete enough. 
                                I took this feedback into account and expanded the program. <br> 
                                The result can be seen here. <a target="_blank" href="program html code.htm"><em>click here</em></a>

                            <br>
                            <h3>Massa model</h3>
                            <p>After making the choices for location, theme and program, it was time to design the building. 
                                The model is designed in such a way that it complies with the program and theme. 
                                The shape is derived from the shape of the plot, so it is nicer to walk passed there and does not disturb. 
                                Also, the idea that people can walk up around the building to get to the park on the roof has had a lot of influence on the design. 
                                The first idea was that there is a staircase on each layer at the rear facade and that you can walk around the entire layer with the area as places where you can also sit and have a picnic. 
                                These were the largest inputs that determined the appearance. 
                                There is also created two outdoor spaces for the brasserie and restaurant.
                            </p>

                                It was time to experiment with the color of the building.
                                In the first two models are the colors chosen based on the theme. 
                                The other 2 models are the colors based on the environment. 
                                It responds to the colors of the iconic rosette building.

                            <p>For now, my preference is for the model where the colors are based on the theme. 
                                Because it is in greater contrast with the buildings and it becomes more of a building of its own and not a building like others in the environment.

                        <p style="text-align: left;"> <br><br>With this feedback in mind, a new model has created. 
                            The new model has a few major changes. First, the backside on the theatre side has been reworked. 
                            Know the whole building has the same shape/motion. 
                            With a slightly different rooftop. 
                            Because the backside was not ecstatically pleasing towards the theatre. 
                            Therefore are these changes made. 
                            The idea behind the changes was that the building looks better from every side instead of only the front and left side. 
                            The roof breaks that shape/motion and creates a little covered roof and more space for the roof park. 
                            The other major change is that the outside stair now going slowly upwards. 
                            With a slope of 3% and a height of about 3 meters. 
                            As displayed in the side view below.

                                By answering three statements about Dutch architecture.</p>

                                </ul>
                                Dutch architecture is for me an architecture where everything is possible. 
                                An architecture that is innovative where there is experimentation and where the architecture is closely related to urban development. 
                                An architecture that has delivered several great architects and consists of many different styles. 
                                A place where they are open to some different styles and shapes. not just the standard.

                                The Netherlands is as an innovative country. 
                                It ranks second when it comes to innovation. With these sectors as power-driven behind this. 
                                Wind & Energy, ICT & Software, Universities / Science parks, Technology and logistics, Garden & greenhouse construction. 
                                Even though the construction sector does not have an impact on this, you can still see the innovations making its way to the construction world. 
                                Most of the innovation is for the installations, making buildings more sustainable. Buildings are becoming more efficient, sustainable and smarter. 
                                But the process is also changing, with better software for drawing programs, VR, faster and better factories. 
                                The building industry is improving with newer ideas and ways to produce. and deliver.

                                Below you can see the building “de Rotterdam”. 
                                It is designed by the company OMA. 
                                This company is also known for its innovative ideas.
                                What makes this building so innovative is that it is energy efficient, with frugal consumption and maximum use of daylight and an optimal air conditioning system. 
                                This is a smart design with innovative applications that is flexible and easy to split up.

                            The Netherlands is also a country to experiment with architecture. 
                            It is a country what you really should visit as an architect. 
                            It also is known as the Mekka for Europe's architectures and a must-see playground for architecture addicts. 
                            This is due to the many variations and unique buildings. 
                            One of the reasons is through collaborations with other professions such as artists. 
                            Below is a picture of the Cube Houses in Rotterdam and was designed by architect Piet Blom in the 1970s.<br>
                            The building is designed to give architectural character to an area that was largely destroyed by World War II bombing. 
                            The unique cubed houses are tilted at 45 degrees atop hexagon-shaped bases. 
                            Figuratively, the houses were designed to represent trees and grouped together to appear as a forest, while on a functional level, elevating the houses on "trunks" maximized public space below and gave views from above. 
                            Underneath sit a museum of chess pieces, shops and waterfront cafes, while the larger cubes have been converted into a hostel for those who want to experience an overnight stay.

                                </ul>
                                Because the Netherlands is such a small country, you often see a close connection with urban planners. 
                                Each m2 must be determined and have a purpose. 
                                This ensures that good cooperation is required. 
                                As a result of the collaboration, the building becomes more interesting, because things are combined that were previously not thought of. 
                                Like the building below. 
                                This is the Rotterdam food market. 
                                A market designed in the shape of a giant aircraft hangar. 
                                It is a covered market and an apartment complex together. 
                                With a large parking lot underneath. 
                                Every cubic meter has been carefully considered and determined. 
                                The building is also very experimental. 
                                Due to the special shape and combination of functions.

                                </ul>
                                When I look back at my work I see that the characteristics are reflected in the design. 
                                The building is being used for experiments with a different kind of park than that Arnhem is used to. 
                                The park rises a few meters into the air and is reached via a natural staircase that goes around the building. 
                                The old park makes way for the building, but it gives back more park than it was. The lot is also used effectively. 
                                In a place where there was only a park before is now a larger park, 3 shops, 1 restaurant and a brasserie in return.

                                The design did not take much account of innovative ideas. Although this is very difficult, I would think about this more in the next design or at least give them the space to apply that. I would also like to take the environment into account a bit more.

                                <p> The first semester is over and continues into the second semester. 
                                    In the first semester, it was mainly researching and designing the project. 
                                    In the second semester, we're going to continue working with the model from semester 1. 
                                    Most of the decisions are fixed from this model. Now it's time to further develop the building. 
                                    This is done by adding a construction and making the characteristic appearance, plans, sections, elevation and details. 
                                    This is what semester 2 will be about. <br>

                                        The same goes for the intermediate beams. 
                                        Even though it gives a clear picture of the construction. 
                                        This model was therefore presented and questions were asked to the constructor. 
                                        Feedback and response from the constructor were given about this. As described below.</p>

                                        With this feedback in mind, we looked at modifications for the building. 
                                        For example, it still missed the construction for the outside staircase around and the construction inside. 
                                        The constructor has handled some questions from me. 
                                        The questions were about the floor spans, about the construction outside and the stability.

                                        This is the modified model. 
                                        The inner construction has been added to this as well as the outer construction. 
                                        With the outside construction, you can see below how the platform works on the construction and above you only see the construction itself. 
                                        But the platforms will be applied everywhere, not just below. 
                                        This will be better visualized later.

                                    <h3>Characteristic appearance, Plans, Sections and Elevations</h3>
                                    <p>This section deals with the appearance of the building and the accompanying drawings. 
                                        It was difficult to work this out because I couldn't get the model into the program properly. 
                                        For this, I chose to draw the materials instead of using the computer. 
                                        The exterior staircase has not yet been visualized in the characteristic appearance and the elevational drawings. 
                                        I had a lot of trouble with this. 
                                        I'm still working on this and figuring out how to visualise it.

                                        It was a lot of work in a few weeks and with the fact that it was not working in the computer program properly, this was what I made. 
                                        Some adjustments can still be made such as. 
                                        The construction is not in place, no measure lines or height lines, 
                                        Lack of color. 
                                        The cross-section is not well placed under each other. 
                                        These are all things that can still be adjusted. 
                                        I have also received feedback on this from the teachers, which is about the same.

                                        As you can see, the feedback is pretty much the same and there are plenty of things that still need to be adjusted. 
                                        So these are my plans to change or add things.
                                        The views will be with material, surroundings and the stairs. 
                                        In the plans, the construction is added, dimensions, different functions and areas and the north arrow. 
                                        At the cross-section, contour lines are added as well as foundation, construction and the whole section will be drawn neater.

                                        As can be seen in the drawings above, I finally managed to visualize the stairs. 
                                        I think it's a shame it didn't work in computer programs because then I could have made renders in Lumion. 
                                        Which is looks more realistic than my drawings. 
                                        The problem was because the facade was mostly curved glass and reflective and that didn't go well together. 
                                        So I assigned this material myself for the views. 
                                        The changes I talked about above these images are all implemented. 
                                        Now there is one more thing to be done for the project and that is to make the characteristic details.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>characteristic details</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Now it was time to make the characteristic details. 
                                        What I found most characterizing of the building was the outside staircase around it. 
                                        This also seemed interesting to me to clarify how this is connected with the inner construction. 
                                        The details, as well as the location of the details, can be seen below. 
                                        At that moment I still didn't have a good visual picture with the stairs so the old picture is used. 
                                        But this also does the job.
                                    </p>

                                        I have made two details. 
                                        Where the first one is to clarify the connection of the main- and stair construction. 
                                        The second one is to see how the main construction is connected around the floor. 
                                        Detail 1 shows how steel construction makes a passage through the curtain wall. 
                                        A lot of loads is placed on the left part. 
                                        This is relinquished to the main construction as much as possible by the bolting and welding the two pieces together. 
                                        At first, it was the intention to make the left part of the grass, but after the conversation with the constructor we came to the conclusion that that would be too heavy,  so it has now changed to wood. 
                                        In the second detail, you can see how the main construction works, but also how the concrete appearance on each floor level is realized without forming an excessive cold bridge. 
                                        Therefore concrete strips are used so that you can still insulate behind it. 
                                        After presenting the details I received feedback which can be seen below.

                                        A couple of things have been adjusted in the details. 
                                        The biggest change is that at detail 1 there is now an interruption in the steel beam. 
                                        The reseason therefore is to help against the cold bridge that was there before. 
                                        The location of the cross-section in detail 1 has also changed slightly, instead of putting the section in front of the steel beam, it has now been decided to cut through the beam. 
                                        So you can better see how the cold bridge is counteracted. 
                                        The extra welding connection is removed because it was unnecessary and an obstacle for mounting on location. 
                                        Furthermore, the frame is attached to the folded sheet metal as can be seen in detail 2. 
                                        These changes make the details much better. 
                                        This was the last assignment for this project and are therefore at the end of the project. 
                                        The results, as well as my opinion on this project, will be displayed below.

                                    A lot has happened during this project both physically and mentally. 
                                    The Search for solutions, presenting and making changes again. 
                                    With new problems emerging.                   
                                    In this part, there is a concluding part about the building and a critical reflection on the work that has been made, what could be improved, what went well and what I thought of it myself.                                </p>

                                    <h3>concluding</h3>

                                        Relocating the Bartok park provided the ideal opportunity for me to respond to the needs of Arnhem centre. 
                                        For this location, it seemed useful to help with the expanding visit to Arnhem. 
                                        With Shops and places to, eat something, drink and sit are always necessary for the inner city of a growing city. 
                                        Where you can have something to eat or drink on the ground floor, Where in the evening this can be transformed for nightlife. 
                                        With the useful large bar. 
                                        And with this Arnhem can help improve the nightlife of the city. 
                                        And if you say the city centre, this naturally includes shops. The first, second and third floors are designed for this. 
                                        With a large store that has enough space for many retailers. 
                                        And enough daylight coming in through the glass facades. Both in the store and when fitting clothes on.
                                        So that you can immediately check the clothes in daylight instead of artificial light. 
                                        The windows are one-way mirrors so they cannot see you from the outside. 
                                        And to complete the picture there is also a restaurant. So this building has multiple functions to help with the city life of Arnhem. 
                                        For daytime as well as in the evening and even at night.
                                        On top of that, the park has a park on the roof, which you can use 24/7 to relax, have a picnic and look out over Arnhem. 
                                        Even if the shops inside are closed, you can use the park because a public outdoor staircase has been created that is integrated with the building. 
                                        As a result, this building offers everything for the city centre in one, and for everyone! 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        I am proud of the final result, but of course, this did not happen automatically. 
                                        It caused the necessary problems and bottlenecks. 
                                        Many things also went well. 
                                        For example, making a website you are reading now went reasonably well. 
                                        I found out about programming at the end of the summer vacation of '20 and tried to combine this with school and making a portfolio was the ultimate opportunity for this. 
                                        Despite that this is not really about architecture but about figuring out how you want to display your work on the site. 
                                        It has some links in the design process. 
                                        So I also learned a lot about that. 
                                        Furthermore, coming up with ideas and what I wanted went very well. 
                                        I thought it was a very strong idea with the right features for a great place. 
                                        And making the building more attractive for a functional building, but still giving it a unique twist through the park on the roof and the stairs to it. 
                                        The elaboration went mostly well, but I noticed that I had a lot of trouble visualizing what I had in mind. 
                                        Now it didn't help that my knowledge about various computer programs is not optimal and with that comes that curved and round shapes are more difficult to work out in these programs. 
                                        Therefore I had a lot of trouble with that until even the last few days before the deadline, but in the end, I managed to visualize it reasonably and at least give a clear picture about the idea. 
                                        There is still room for improvement and I know that I can do that, but in this project that did not turn out quite well. 
                                        I think that was a shame and could have done better. 
                                        As a result, I also needed more time to work out various assignments, such as visualization, elevations, sections and floor plans. 
                                        And that did not benefit the quality of the drawings either. 
                                        These can be clearer and more complete. 
                                        Normally you can also relatively easily get the drawings from various programs. 
                                        This has taught me that it is extremely important to have a clear model in a program. 
                                        Where you can easily adjust things and apply feedback. 
                                        I solved that in other ways, which also worked, but that was sometimes at the expense of the quality. 
                                        I, therefore, going to focus my internship on this to improve. Working with models and visualizing.

                                        Overall, I thought it was a very interesting minor, which taught me a lot about the design process and what problems await an architect. 
                                        With nice excursions in the first part and interesting Guest lectures. 
                                        I'm not sure yet whether it's something for me. 
                                        But I have the next year and a half to find out. 
                                        Through an internship and the graduation assignment, but at least you have helped me a lot and broadened my knowledge. 
                                        Therefore thank the Teachers, guest lecturer, tour guides and of course my fellow students very much. And thank you for reading!
